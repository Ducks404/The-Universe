## Machine Learning
>Make machines think without explicit coding | Subfield of Artificial Intelligence

## How it works
- Supervised Learning (with labels)
- Unsupervised Learning (without labels)

## Deep Learning
>Uses neural networks to model human brain using nodes

## Model Types
### Discriminative
>Identifies
- Probability of Output given Input

### Generative
>Creates content
- Probability of X and Y and creates something new

##### **Hallucinations**
Nonsense results
#### Prompt Design
>Make input to control output of LLM

#### Types
- Text-to-Text
- Text-to-Image
- Text-to-Video/3D
- Text-to-Task

### Foundation Model
>Large Model Pre-trained that can be adapted by fine-tuning the training
