- Starts with population of complete solutions
- Genetic operators: create offspring solutions generation by generation

## Genetic Algorithms
> Evolution of population (a set of solutions) into new populations using operators![[Pasted image 20250521165918.png]]
### Encoding
> The Solution Representation

- Decision Variables of optimisation problem
- Encoded into finite length string. eg bit strings
### Operators
> Method to create new, offspring solutions

- #### Parent Selection
	- Using fitness functions
- #### Cross-over
	- Generate pair of offspring solutions
- #### Mutation
	- Change a decision variable in the offspring
