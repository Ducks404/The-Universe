## Know your network
Have a baseline of normal operations
Compare the network with the baseline

## Monitoring Aspects
### Flow Analysis
Check the service running with the port used and if it matches with the common ports

### Packet Payload Information
Analyse the payload of packets, e.g. sensitive data being sent outside of the network is likely data exfiltration

### Temporal Patterns
Time-based patterns so if traffic is heavy out of usual times, it is suspicious 

## Protect Network
SOC, NOC, IoC
### Monitoring Tools
- IDS
- Network Protocol Analyzer/Sniffer
