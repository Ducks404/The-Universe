## [[Subnetting]]
>Virtually dividing a network into subnetworks by separating network addresses

| Name | Description | Example |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Network address | IP address range of a local network | 198.162.1.0 |
| Host address | IP address of a device | 198.162.1.134 |
| Default gateway | IP address of network device that a packet is sent to when the destination address isn't on the same network | 198.162.1.1 |

## ARP Protocol
>Device 1: Who has this *IP Address*?
>Computer A: That would be me

## DHCP Protocol
>New Device: Does anyone got an IP address for me?
>DHCP Server: Sure you can use *this*
>New Device: Thanks, I'll start using *this*
>DHCP Server: Alright, you can use it for one day
