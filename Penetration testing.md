#### A simulated attack that helps identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, websites, applications, and processes.


### Three objectives
- **Red team** tests simulate attacks to identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, or applications.
- **Blue team** tests focus on defense and incident response to validate an organization's existing security systems.
- **Purple team** tests are collaborative, focusing on improving the security posture of the organization by combining elements of red and blue team exercises.

### Three Types
- **Open-box testing** is when the tester has the same privileged access that an internal developer would have—information like system architecture, data flow, and network diagrams. This strategy goes by several different names, including internal, full knowledge, white-box, and clear-box penetration testing.
- **Closed-box testing** is when the tester has little to no access to internal systems—similar to a malicious hacker. This strategy is sometimes referred to as external, black-box, or zero knowledge penetration testing.
- **Partial knowledge testing** is when the tester has limited access and knowledge of an internal system—for example, a customer service representative. This strategy is also known as gray-box testing.

### Developing Attacker Mindset
- **Identify a target**
- **How can target be accessed**
- **Evaluate Attack Vectors**
- **Find tools and methods**
