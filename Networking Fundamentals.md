## Network definition
A group of connected devices

## Unique Addresses

### IP Address

### Mac Address


## Types of network

### LAN (Local Area Network)
Covers a small space, eg, office or home

### WAN (Wide Area Network)
Covers a large geographical location

## [[Network Security]]
Devices and processes to secure networks

## Network Devices

#### Hubs
*Layer 1*
Repeats all the data it receives to all devices connected to it
#### Switches
*Layer 2*
Sends data to recipient that is meant for
#### Routers
*Layer 3*
Connects one network to other networks
#### Modems
Connect network to internet
#### Wireless Access Points
Sends and receives data through radio waves
#### Virtualization tools

#### Firewalls
Network security device that monitors traffic in and out
#### Server
Provide service for clients

## Cloud Network
Using remote servers to store data and resources accessed via internet
### Benefit
- Reliability
- Decreased Cost
- Increased Scalability
### Cloud service providers
*Have data centers that people can pay to use*
- On-demand storage
- Processing power the client pays for what they need
- Business and web analytics
#### Services
- Software as a Service
- Infrastructure as a Service
- Platform as a Service

## Software Defined Networking
Using software to make a network
### Data Plane
Switches/routers sending data traffic to devices
### Control Plane
Tables that switches/routers use to know where data traffic comes from and should go
### Management Plane
Software users interact with to manage control plane

## Network Communication

### TCP/IP Model
Used as standard in development

| Layer | Name | Example |
|---| --- | ---|
|4 | Application | HTTPS
|3 | Transport | TCP
|2 | Network/Internet | IP
|1 | Network Access | ARP
### OSI Model
Used as standard in communicating and identifying issues in layers

| Layer | Name | Example |
|---| --- | --- |
|7 | Application | SSH
|6 | Presentation | 
|5 | Session |
|4 | Transport | TCP
|3 | Network | IP
|2 | Data Link | ARP
|1 | Physical| Ethernet
