## Protocol Data Unit 
>Transmission units don't care what's inside of them
- Ethernet Frames
- IP packets
- TCP/UDP Data
### Encapsulation/decapsulation

## TCP Flags in TCP Header
Tells how to deal with packet
### Control flags
- SYN
- PSH
- RST
- FIN

## IP Flags in IP Header
Tells how the data should be handled
### Maximum Transmission Unit
Helps with not fragmenting but still accomodates with the network
- Finding MTU automatically is hard because each place has different MTU and ICMP can't be filtered

Max IP Packet for ethernet frame is 1500 bytes

Example:
IP Payload is 44 bytes but MTU is 16 bytes
Payload split into 3 different frames of 16,16,12

#### Troubleshooting
- MTU only set once
- MTU changes usually when tunneling
- Don't Fragment flag forces to not fragment and if size too big, router will send ICMP back
- Ping with 1472 bytes; 1500-8bytes of ping -20bytes of IP address
		Windows: ping -f -l 1472 8.8.8.8
		Mac&Linux: ping -D -s 1472 8.8.8.8
