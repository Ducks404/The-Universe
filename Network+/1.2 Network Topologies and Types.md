## Topologies
### Star
- Switch in middle
- Used in big and small networks

### Ring
- Token rings no longer with us
- Used in MAN/WAN
	- Dual rings
	- Built in fault tolerance as a severance between two nodes will just loopback data until it gets to other end

### Bus
- Coaxial as bus cable but prone to complete disconnect
- Controller Area Network like in cars still use Bus
	- CAN Bus

### Mesh
- Multiple links to other sites with lots of connections
	- Fully mesh
	- Partially mesh
### Hybrid
- All of above combined

## Wireless
### Infrastructure
- Access point

### Ad Hoc
- Direct communication with other device

### Ad Hoc Mesh
- Using Ad hoc to connect to multiple devices creating a cloud of sorts
	- Self-forming and self-healing


## Types
### Peer-to-peer
- Devices act as client and server at same time
- Talk to everyone
+
- Easy and low cost
-
- Difficult to administer and secure

### Client-server
- Dedicated server hardware
- Talk through server
+
- Higher performance
- Easier administration as only need to change from server
-
- Cost to maintain server
- Needs administrator

### LAN
- Local is relative so use speed as a metric
- High speeds
- Ethernet or 802.11 speeds

### MAN
- Multiple buildings in a city to connect
- 3rd party to do this for you
- Government usually do this because spread out

### WAN
- Global scale
- Connects LANs
	- Slower than a LAN
- Many different technologies
	- MPLS, Point-to-point serial
	- Can go through cables on Earth or satellites

### WLAN
- 802.11 networks
- Limited geographical area
- can be extended with access points

### PAN
- own private network
- using bluetooth stuff

### CAN
- Like MAN size but close together so can use LAN technologies
- Runs own fiber

## Network Attached Storage
Access file at file level, change one byte -> upload whole file again

## Storage Area Network
Access file at block-level, change only the blocks (faster more efficient)

## Either way need large bandwith


## Multi Protocol Label Switching
Uses labels to send IP Packets through pre defined Label-Switched Path
Doesn't matter what protocol, edge routers will 'push' and 'pop' labels based on packet

## multipoint Generic Router Encapsulation
creates network connections dynamically
seen in:
- dynamic multipoint VPNs

dynamic Mesh self healing and self making

## Software-Defined Network
[[Networking Fundamentals#Software Defined Networking]]
Defined using software instead of the physical connections
Use: Connects to cloud easier

## WAN Termination
Demarcation point, used for troubleshooting

ISP controls demarc using Smartjack (Network Interface Unit), bulti-in diagnostics and status lights

## Virtual Networks
from 100 physical servers -> 1 physical server

### Network Function Virtualization
- Replace network devices with virtual ones
	- Managed by **hypervisor**
- Works same as physical ones
- Customisation is quick and easy through hypervisor
- *Deployment options* are many
#### Hypervisor
- Manages virtual platform and guest OS
- Hardware management
- Single console control
#### vSwitch
legit just switch but virtual
#### vNIC
Network Interface Card for each virtual machine

## Provider Links
### Satelite
### Copper
- Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line
### Cable Broadband
- Broad number of frequencies
- Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification
### Fiber
Optical
