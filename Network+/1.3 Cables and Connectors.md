## Twisted Pair Copper
- 4 pairs
- each pair has equal and opposite signals
- twisting cancels out the interferences
- Different pairs have different twist rates

## Coaxial
- Two or more objects share an axis:
	- Inner copper cable
	- Dielectric insulator
	- Metal shielding
	- Plastic Jacket
- Cable modem/TV
- RG-6: Television, modem internet

## Twinaxial
- Two inner conductors
- common 10G over copper with sfp transceivers 
- Full duplex
- 5m Max
- low cost
- low latency than tcp

## Standards
ISO/IEC 11801
#### Termination standards
- T568A: wGreen - Green - wOrange - Blue - wBlue - Orange - wBrown - Brown
- T568B: wOrange - Orange - wGreen - Blue - wBlue - Green - wBrown - Brown

## Fiber Optics
- Light
- no RadioFrequency signal
- Signal slow to degrade
- Immune to RF interference
