## ✅ Summary of Activities

Today, I was introduced to the use of **Suricata IDS/IPS** for alert triage and monitoring within the organization’s network. I worked on reviewing existing dashboards to analyze sample network alerts, focusing on:
- **Network Scanning Attempts**
- **SQL Injection (SQLi) Attempts**
- General intrusion detection alerts

I practiced examining alert logs and familiarized myself with key Suricata components such as signatures, EVE JSON logs, and common alert attributes (source IP, destination IP, timestamp, signature name).

## ✅ Key Learning Points

- **Suricata IDS:** How to use Suricata dashboards for alert triage, understanding signatures, and basic log analysis.
- **Cyber Kill Chain:** Learned the stages of common cyber attacks, from reconnaissance to data exfiltration.
- **Defense in Depth (DiD):** Understood the concept of layered security controls across multiple systems.
- **Linux File System:** Reviewed the Linux directory structure, including critical folders like `/etc`, `/var`, and `/home`.

## ✅ Tasks Assigned

- Begin developing **Incident Response Playbooks** for recurring alert types, specifically:
  - SQL Injection Alerts
  - Network Scanning Attempts
- Document investigation steps, escalation criteria, and response actions for these alerts.

## ✅ Challenges & Questions

- I am still working to clarify the **criteria for alert escalation** and when an incident should be escalated to senior analysts or incident responders.

---

## ✅ Planned Activities for Tomorrow

- Receive an in-depth briefing on the organization’s **network architecture** and **network zones**.
- Learn about the placement of IDS/IPS sensors and gain familiarity with network segments such as internal, DMZ, VPN, and external-facing systems.

---

## ✅ Personal Notes & Study Goals

- Review IP addressing, network zones, and common network devices.
- Prepare questions regarding network visibility, critical assets, and security monitoring coverage.
